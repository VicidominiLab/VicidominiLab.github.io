Within the STED microscopy scenario our group developed and is developing a series of innovative methods which reduce the illumination (peak) intensity required by STED microscopy, thus providing great benefits for long-term live-cell imaging applications.

A first method explores the spectral condition at the basis of STED microscopy. STED microscopy improves the spatial resolution by depleting -- via stimulated emission (SE) -- the fluorescence from the periphery of the excitation spot of a conventional laser scanning microscope. The depletion is induced by a second doughnut-shaped beam, the STED beam, which is overlapped with the excitation beam and is red-shifted in wavelength, with respect to the fluorophore emission peak. Such red-shifting helps to avoid direct excitation of the fluorophore with the STED beam, which would otherwise introduce a strong (anti-Stokes emission) background in the image, but reduces the efficiency of the SE depletion, thus requiring an increase of the intensity of the STED beam to achieve effective sub-diffraction resolution. We introduce a synchronous detection scheme into the STED architecture (sync-STED microscopy), which is able to suppress the anti-Stokes emission background. In short, sync-STED microscopy allows for  STED beam with wavelength closer to the fluorophore emission peak -- higher efficiency of SE, thus it allows for reducing the illumination to obtain background-free high-resolution STED images.

A second class of methods explores the temporal condition at the basis of STED microscopy. For a given number of stimulating photons (STED beam intensity), the higher depletion -- thus the higher resolution -- is obtained when the photons acts immediately after the fluorophores have been excited. For this reason, the most effective STED microscopy architecture uses synchronised excitation and STED pulsed beams laser. However, the high peak intensity typical of picosecond pulsed lasers can induce substantial photo-bleaching and photo-toxicity. We demonstrated that implementing STED microscopy with a (sub-)nanosecond pulsed STED beam -- lower peak intensity, but lower depletion -- reduces photo-damages, whilst time-gated detection compensates for the reduction of depletion. More, recently we also solved the draw-back of time-gated detection, i.e., the reduction of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We implemented a time-resolved STED microscope and we used the phasor analysis of the pixels' fluorescent dynamics to compensate for the inefficient depletion of the (sub-)nano-second laser. We also demonstrated that \textbf{the phasor analysis can be combined with two-photon-excitation STED (2PE-STED) microscopy to achieve deep high-resolution imaging} also with low-efficiency -- from a SE point of view -- continuous-wave STED beam.

While STED microscopy provides exquisite nanoscale structural information, its point-scanning architecture precludes the direct observation of fast biological process, such as the diffusion of small-biomolecules (e.g., the RNA into the cytoplasm). However, by combing the ability of STED microscopy in generating nanoscale observation volumes, with the ability of fluorescence-correlation-spectroscopy (FCS) to extract the diffusion parameters of the molecules travelling across this observation volume, it is possible to reveal nanoscale spatial heterogeneity in the dynamics of different biomolecules. Our group, in collaboration with the Nanoscopy and NIC$@$IIT group of Prof. Alberto Diaspro, developed a new STED-FCS method able to reveal both spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The method uses the information provided by a time-resolved (time-correlated-single-photon-counting) STED measurement to simultaneously probe the diffusion of a class of biomolecules within decreasing observation volumes. The same method also allowed -- for the first time -- to use STED-FCS within complex three-dimensional environments, such as the cell cytoplasm.
