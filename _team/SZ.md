<h2>Short Bio</h2>

Sabrina Zappone studied Medical Biotechnologies at University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Modena, Italy). In 2019, she moved to University of York (York, UK) for a two-month traineeship. She obtained the M.Sc. in 2020 with a thesis entitled “Structural characterization of tardigrade Small Heat Shock Proteins”. After graduation, she joined the Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy group at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (Genoa, Italy) as a fellow student. Since November 2021, she is a Ph.D. student in Bionanotechnology (Bioengineering and Robotics) at the University of Genoa (Genoa, Italy), in collaboration with IIT and under the supervision of Dr. Giuseppe Vicidomini. Her research interests include the analysis of biomolecular dynamics, especially those involved in human diseases, using super-resolution microscopy tools.
