<h2>Short Bio</h2>
Eleonora Perego studied Physics at the University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy). She got a M. Sc. in Physics in 2015, after a period at the AMOLF Institute(Amsterdam, the Netherlands), working in the group of "Developmental Biology" of Dr. Jeroen van Zon. In 2020 she obtained a PhD in Biophysics, titled "Studying molecular interaction under flow with fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy", working in the group of "Cellular Biophysics" of Prof. Dr. Sarah Koester (Göttingen, Germany), where she studied with fluorescence spectroscopy methods combined with microfluidic approaches protein-protein interactions.

Since 2021, Eleonora is working at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa (Italy) in the Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy research line of Dr. Giuseppe Vicidomini as a post-doctoral researcher. Her research interests include the application of fluorescence spectroscopy methods, such as fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging, to biological questions, ranging from neuroscience to RNA biology. 
<h2>Projects Description</h2>
**SPAD-FLFS**: 
In this project, we employ the enrich-information dataset provided by a 5x5 cooled SPAD array detector implemented into a laser-scanning microsope to perform multimodal fluorescence fluctuation analysis on biological samples. In combination with a fast and flexible data-acquisition card developed in our group (the BrightEyes-TTM platform), and a pulsed-laser, each pixel of the detector can register the arrival time of a photon with sub-nanosecond temporal resolution. Thus, this setup can simultaneously be employed to perform imaging, fluorescence fluctation spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime, opening up several new ways of accurately study biological processes.
In particular, we combine fluorescence spectroscopy methods, such as spot-variation FCS, fluorescence lifetime or image-correlation spectroscopy, in order to investigate the dynamics of biological molecules in combination with structural changes and cellular functions. 
This, will help to elucidate several molecular processes such as the ones happening during RNA-regulation and synaptic plasticity formation.
