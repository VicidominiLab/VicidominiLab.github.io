<h2>ShortBio</h2>
"Not a Physicist. Not an Engineer. All he knows is what he's not. If only he could see what he is." <br/><br/>
Andrea Bucci studied Engineering Physics at Politecnico of Milan (Milano, Italy) and subsequently at KTH (Stockholm, Sweden), where he got his M.Sc. in 2019 with a thesis entitled "Extended Parallelization of the Illumination in Optical Nanoscopy". After his graduation, he worked for 6 months as a student intern at KAUST (Thuwal, Saudi Arabia).<br/>  
Since 2020, Andrea is a PhD student under the supervision of Giuseppe Vicidomini in the Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy group at the Italian Institute of Technology (Genoa, Italy), working in the research line of the "BrightEyes" ERC project. <br/><br/>
His research interests include the design, realization and characterization of optical bioimaging methods with a special focus on smart data analysis and automation. He also has a crush for simulations and analytical models.

<h2>Projects Description</h2>
**3D RT-SMT**:
Fluorescence single-molecule tracking (SMT) techniques have enabled the observation of dynamic behaviors of molecules inside complex biological systems. However, accessing this information always comes with a price, such as invasiveness, and the microscopes required to perform such experiments are usually quite complex to build and utilize.<br/>
The aim of the project is to develop a novel, feedback-based 3D Real-Time SMT implementation based on a simple confocal microscope equipped with the SPAD array detector. The key idea is to think at this matrix detector as a camera with unique features, such as the independence of each pixel (which means no framerate). Any displacement of the particle under observation leads to a variation of the distribution of recorded signal, thus allowing the estimation of the particle position.<br/>
This unique paradigm will enable studies of biomolecular behaviors, interactions and self-organization at near-physiological conditions with unprecedented simplicity and flexibility.
