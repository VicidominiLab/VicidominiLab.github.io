<h2>Short Bio</h2>
Mattia Donato studied at the Department of Physics, University of Genoa (Italy) and he obtained the physics bachelor degree (2010) with a thesis about the tests and the characterization of a prototype of compact gamma-camera for Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT).

He studied as exchange student at the Uppsala University (Sweden) and there he did an internship at the Fusion Diagnostics Group of Applied Nuclear Physics, Department Of Physics And Astronomy, where he prepared his thesis. In the 2013, at University of Genoa, he obtained the master degree with a thesis about the characterization of a neutron detector designed for the nuclear fusion experiment Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST).

He worked four years at the Detector Development Group of the institute European XFEL (Hamburg, Germany) as doctoral candidate. In the 2018, he obtained the doctoral degree in Physics from Hamburg University with a thesis about the commissioning and the characterization of a 4.5 MHz single photon soft X-ray camera (DSSC ladder) designed for European XFEL. 

After about a couple of years of work experiences in the Genoa industries, in April 2020 he was employed as technician at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa, Italy, in the Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy research line of Dr. Giuseppe Vicidomini.
