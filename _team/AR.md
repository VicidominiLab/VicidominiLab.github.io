<h2>Short Bio</h2>
Alessandro Rossetta earned his MSs in Biomedical Engineering in 2016 from University of California, Irvine (USA). In 2013 and 2010, he earned his MSc from University of RomaTre and his BSc from University La Sapienza, Rome respectively. Before joining again the academic environment at IIT and Unige he worked, until 2018, as R&D Software Engineer and Project Manager for Naviop, Forl√¨, Italy. His current research interests mainly focus on Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM), Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) and Antibunching applications. His expertise relys in FPGA-programming within the development of photon-counting microscopy and spectroscopy instrumentation. 

<h2>Projects Description</h2>
**Development of a multi-channel FPGA-based time-domain acquisition plaftorm**: Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and time-resolved fluorescence-lifetime spectroscopy are among the most important tools to observe bio-molecular processes within living cells. Most of FCS and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy implementations mainly rely on single-element detectors (i.e., PMT, APD, SPAD or Hybrid detectors) since they have superior temporal resolution and provide the single photon-timing information. However, single-element detectors lose the information about the spatial distribution of the fluorescent light focused on the detector sensitive area.

Recently, novel detector arrays with different spatial and geometric features but temporal characteristics similar to single-element detector have been introduced. The use of such detectors is already showing great benefits in current fluorescent signals analysis thanks to the introduction of the spatial information.

That is why a multi-channel FPGA-based time-tagging platform is being developed and built during this PhD program: to take best advantage of the synergetic combination between spatial and temporal information contents in order to further enhance the current state of the art instrumentation for fluorescence detection and analysis.
