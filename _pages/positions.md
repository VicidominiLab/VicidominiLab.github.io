<h2>Ph.D. in New Developments in Fluorescence Lifetime Microscopy </h2>
<h3>Published:</h3>
6th June 2023 - <span style="color:green"> Opening Soon </span>
<h3>Type of Position:</h3>
Ph.D. Fellowship in Bioengineering and Robotics, Curriculum Bionanotechnologies
<h3>Description:</h3>
Optical microscopy is one of the least invasive techniques to visualise biological structure and function – on almost the molecular scale – in living cells and organisms. However, understanding many of the fundamental biological processes relevant to health and disease remains beyond the capabilities of conventional optical microscopy. We aim to design and develop cutting-edge microscopes and analytical tools that allow biologists to peer inside living systems with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolutions and ranges, reduced invasiveness, and augmented information content. To reach this goal, our projects synergically integrate novel photonics technologies, labelling protocols, optical architectures, spectroscopy techniques, and machine learning approaches. Although technology development will always be our focus, we also collaborate with biologists to road-test and refine our tools – and to ensure they enable new biological insights.

The PhD student will be fully integrated into this general mission of the laboratory with a dedicated project on fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is an imaging technique which combines the conventional intensity characteristic of the fluorescence signal with its nanosecond scale temporal dynamics. This combination provides access to both the specimen’s structural and  functional information. Indeed, it allows mapping protein-protein interactions and biochemical reaction in living cells. In the last years our group contributed to combining FLIM to super-resolution microscopy –by introducing the concept of fluorescence lifetime image scanning microscopy [1], and to democratise FLIM – by developing a series of enabling low-cost technologies [1,2]. The PhD student will continue in this direction and his/her specific project will be designed according to his/her background and skills. In particular, the project will be chosen within one or a combination of these goals: (i) the combination of fluorescence lifetime assay with other advanced microscopy techniques; (ii) the development of robust and user-friendly analysis pipelines; (iii) application of FLIM to understand RNA molecule functions and their role in human diseases in the context of RNA therapeutics.

<h3>Requirements:</h3>
The project is extremely multi-disciplinary, and it involves many different aspects of natural sciences. Hence, the position is open to candidates having a Master Degree or equivalent Degree in Engineering, Physics or related disciplines.

<!--- <h2>Ph.D. in Single-Molecule-Tracking and Imaging with Single-Photon Detector Array </h2>
<h3>Published:</h3>
13th June 2022 - <span style="color:green"> Open (Deadline 30th June 2022)</span>
<h3>Type of Position:</h3>
Ph.D. Fellowship in Bioengineering and Robotics, Curriculum Bionanotechnologies
<h3>Description:</h3>
The aim of the Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy group is the theoretical design, development and validation of novel optical and analytical tools that allow the modern biologist to peer inside living biological systems with unprecedented temporal/spatial abilities and massive information content.
The overall objective of the BrightEyes project (ERC–CoG–2018) is to develop a set of innovative and non-invasive imaging and spectroscopy tools able to observe a single- biomolecule at work in a living multi-cellular system. Specifically, by exploring novel single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays detector, the BrightEyes project will implement an optical system able to continuously (i) track in real-time a biomolecule of interest; (ii) measure its nano-environment and its structural changes; (iii) observe its interactions with other biomolecules; (iv) visualize its sub-cellular micro- environment with nanometer resolution.
Within the context of the BrightEye project, the prime goal of the project will be the implementation of a feedback-based single-molecule tracking (SMT) system and a single-molecule imaging system on a point-scanning microscope equipped with a small SPAD array detector – instead of the classical single-point detector. Both for tracking and imaging the system will be able to register the fluorescence lifetime of the tracked/imaged molecule simultaneously also.

<h2>Ph.D. in Investigation of Biomolecular Processes with Advance Light Microscopy </h2>
<h3>Published:</h3>
29th April 2021 - <span style="color: red"> Close (Deadline 15th June 2021)</span>
<h3>Type of Position:</h3>
Ph.D. Fellowship in Bioengineering and Robotics, Curriculum Bionanotechnologies
<h3>Description:</h3>
The processes of Life are naturally dynamic in space and time from the molecular to the organismal level. Among the different imaging techniques, light microscopy is the only one that potentially can work across this full scale of biological organisation. Ideally, light microscopy is able to visualise the inner workings of proteins, protein complexes, organelles, cells, tissues, organs and whole organisms. However, in practice each specific microscopy techniques poses some fundamental limitations in terms of spatiotemporal resolutions/ranges, labelling, invasiveness, and information contents.
The core research of our group (Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy, MMS) is the design, development, and validation of novel optical, biological and computational tools that allow the modern biologists to peer inside living cells with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolutions/ranges, minimal invasiveness, and augmented information content. This goal can be achieved only by working across many disciplines, from physics to engineering, from computer science to biology.

The PhD student will be fully integrated in this general mission and will use the most advanced optical methods and analysis tools developed by the group, and available at the Italian Institute of Technology, to answer fundamental questions for RNA biology and/or neuroscience. As example, our group recently developed a fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) technique based a novel single-photon detector array. This novel system allows to implement several FFS techniques (such as spot-variation fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, pair-correlation analysis, and image-derived mean squared displacement analysis) combined with different time-resolved spectroscopy method (such as fluorescence lifetime), thus opening to high-information content experiments for deciphering biomolecule dynamics and interactions in living-cell. The group validated the system on test samples, and now is aiming to apply the method to study RNA-based biomolecules and synaptic proteins. A particular attention will be dedicated to question concerning the role of non-coding RNA in gene expression control.
The PhD student will benefit significantly from the active collaborations of the MMS group with the several groups of the LifeTech domain within the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia. 
 
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
The project is open to candidate having a Master’s degree in one of the following areas: Engineering, and Biological Science. Ability and motivation to work independently as well as collaboratively in an interdisciplinary team is very important. Good English language speaking and writing skills are required. Previous research experiences in cell culture, cellular transfection, and fluorescence microscope are very important.

<h2>Postdoc Position in Advanced Fluorescence Microscopy</h2>
<h3>Published:</h3>
14th October 2020 - <span style="color: red">Closed (Deadline 13th November 2020)</span>
<h3>Type of Position:</h3>
Ph.D. Postdoc Fellow
<h3>Description:</h3>
Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT (www.iit.it) is offering a Postdoctoral position to a well-qualified, highly motivated and dynamic young scientist who wishes to develop cutting edge optical microscopy, in a friendly and stimulating environment. The successful candidate will join the “Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy” Research Line led by Dr. Giuseppe Vicidomini.

Optical microscopy and spectroscopy techniques, for already almost a century, have been the workhorses in the studies of structure and function of cells. However spatiotemporal resolution, labelling, and contrast methods of  conventional microscopy and spectroscopy techniques have some fundamental limitations, that currently hinder the investigation of the smallest and fastest puzzling mysteries of life. Moreover, a large part of the information collected by a microscope is often lost (because of averaging, for example) or not taken advantage of. The core research of the “Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy” group is the design, development, and validation of novel optical and analytical tools to break these limitations, and thus, to allow the future biologists to study living cells and organisms with unprecedented temporal-spatial resolutions, minimal invasiveness, and maximal information content.
As a Postdoc, the selected candidate will implement a custom microscopy architecture for fast, deep and multi-dimensional imaging -- by developing novel optical as well as computational approaches. All the latest tools in a microscope-builders toolbox will be available to the selected candidate, who will also have the possibility to give his/her contribution to different application projects. Indeed, the developed microscopy architecture will be used both in the context of Life sciences, e.g. for RNA imaging, and material science, e.g. for material-interface imaging. 
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
Applicants must hold an internationally recognized Ph.D. or equivalent degree (or evidence of its completion in the nearest future) preferably in applied Physics or Bioengineering. Strong experiences in optics and microscopy are a must. Experience in adaptive optics with deformable mirrors and/or spatial light modulators is highly desirable. Coding skills (Python and C#) and expertise in hardware control (FPGA, with LabVIEW) will be considered a plus. The ability and motivation to work independently as well as collaboratively in an interdisciplinary team are crucial. Good English language skill, both spoken and written, is required.
Salary will be commensurate to qualifications and experience and in line with international standards.
The selected candidate will engage in regular mentoring sessions with the PI, providing opportunities to interact and collaborate with research groups across disciplines, thereby preparing the Postdoc for an independent academic career.
<h3>How to Apply:</h3>
Applications, including detailed Curriculum Vitae, a cover letter, a research statement and name and contacts of 2 referees, must be submitted through the online form at this <a href="https://iit.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?lang=en&job=2000003P"><span style="color:blue">link</span></a>.

<h3>Type of Position:</h3>
Ph.D. Postdoc Fellow
<h3>Description:</h3>
Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT (www.iit.it) invites qualified level applicants for a Post Doc position at the “Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy” Research Line lead by Dr. Giuseppe Vicidomini.

Recent technological advancements in fluorescence microscopy have made it possible to collect rich, multi-parametric data – such as the emission spectra, the excitation spectra, the excited-state lifetime, the polarization, and the photon statistics – of the specimen under investigation, simultaneously, in a single measurement, with a single instrument. As a result, the collected data cannot anymore be considered simply an image, but a multi-dimensional dataset from which one can not only extract the specimen structural information, but functional information as well. Currently, there is a huge lack of analytical methods and algorithms to effectively take advantage of the wealth of information that the current state-of-the-art microscopes collect. As a Postdoc at MMS (IIT) the selected candidate will take charge of developing such methods.
The selected candidate will use different computational tools, including deep/machine learning approaches, to explore this multi-dimensional data and extract more detailed sample structural and functional information. The candidate will work on datasets collected by different microscopy architectures, from super-resolution microscopes to conventional systems, having the possibility to give his/her contribution to many different projects, and at the same time to get a very broad understanding of the data analysis workflows in different microscopy methods and applications.
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
Essentials qualifications for this position include a Ph.D. in computer science, physics, engineering, or closely related discipline. Advanced coding skills (Python and C#), abilities in maintaining and sharing code repositories (git), and previous experience with deep learning are highly desirable. The ability and motivation to work independently as well as collaboratively in an interdisciplinary team are crucial. Good English language skill, both spoken and written, is required. 
Expertise in microscopy and controlling system will be considered a plus.
