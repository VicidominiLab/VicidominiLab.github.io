<h2>Our Goal</h2>
<body align="justify">
Optical microscopy is one of the least invasive techniques to visualise biological structure and function – on almost the molecular scale – in living cells and organisms. However, understanding many of the fundamental biological processes relevant to health and disease remain beyond the capabilities of conventional optical microscopy. Our aim is to design and develop cutting-edge microscopy and analytical tools that allow the biologists to peer inside living systems with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolutions and ranges, minimal invasivity, and augmented information content. To reach this goal, our projects synergically integrate novel (quantum) photonics technologies, labelling protocols, optical architectures, spectroscopy techniques, and machine learning approaches. Although technology development will always be our focus, we also collaborate with biologists to road-test and refine our tools – and to ensure they enable new biological insights.
  
<!--- Because of their non-invasive effect on living systems, light microscopy and spectroscopy have been the workhorses for studies of structures and functions at the cellular, sub-cellular and molecular levels for almost a century.
However, many challenging questions of molecular and cellular biology remain beyond their conventional capabilities. The spatiotemporal resolutions, the labeling, and the contrast methods of conventional microscopy and spectroscopy pose fundamental limits for investigating the smallest and fastest puzzling mysteries of life. Furthermore, the information content potentially encoded in a microscopy or spectroscopy experiement is often lost (because of averaging, for example) or not decoded.
The core research of our group is the design, development, and validation of novel optical and analytical tools that allow the modern biologists to peer inside living cells and organisms with unprecedented temporal-spatial resolutions, minimal invasivity, and augmented information content.
This goal can be achieved only by working across many disciplines, from physics to engineering, from computer science to biology. Our projects want to synergically integrate novel contrast imaging mechanisms, labeling probes, optical architectures, and computational approaches that can be readily adopted by researchers all over the world.-->
