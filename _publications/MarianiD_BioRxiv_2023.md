<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Stress Granules (SG) formation is a cellular protection mechanism, constituting a storage for untranslated mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs); however, these condensates can turn into pathological aggregates, related to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases like Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). This transition towards cytotoxic inclusions is triggered by ALS-causative mutations in the RBP FUS, which lead to its cytoplasmic mis-localization and accumulation in SG. Here, we describe the SG transcriptome in a neural context and describe several features for RNA recruitment in SG. We demonstrate that SG dynamics and RNA content are strongly modified by the incorporation of mutant FUS, switching to a more unstructured, AU-rich SG transcriptome. Moreover, we show that mutant FUS, together with its protein interactors and their target RNAs, are responsible for the reshaping of the mutant SG transcriptome with alterations that can be linked to neurodegeneration. Therefore, our data give a comprehensive view of the molecular differences between physiological and pathological SG in ALS conditions, showing how FUS mutations impact the RNA and protein population of these condensates.
