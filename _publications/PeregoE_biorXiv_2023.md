<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Quantitative fluorescence microscopy is experiencing an important revolution thanks to single-photon array detectors. These detectors provide users with so far inaccessible specimen information: The distribution of the specimen’s fluorescence emission at single-photon level and high spatiotemporal sampling. In laser-scanning microscopy, this photon-resolved measurement has enabled robust fluorescence lifetime imaging at sub-diffraction spatial resolution, thus opening new perspectives for structural and functional imaging. Despite these significant advances in imaging, studying the time evolution of biological processes remains a considerable challenge. Here we present a com-prehensive framework of live-cell spectroscopy methodologies – compatible with imaging – to investigate bio-molecular processes at various spatiotemporal scales. We use photon-resolved spatial and temporal measurements granted by a single-photon array detector to boost the information content of a unified fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime experiment. To demonstrate the potential of this approach, we investigate the phase transition of liquid-like condensates during oxidative stress inside living cells. These condensates are generally found in several cellular processes and exhibit substantial variations in molecular composition, size, and kinetics, posing a significant challenge for quantifying their underlying molecular dynamics. This study demonstrates how the pro-posed approach reveals the mutual dynamics of different RNA-binding proteins involved in the stress granules formation – inaccessible to imaging alone. We observe condensate formation by performing time-lapse super-resolved imaging of the cellular macro-environment while simultaneously monitoring the molecular mobility, the sub-diffraction environment organization, interactions, and nano-environment properties through fluorescence lifetime fluctuation spectroscopy. We are confident that our framework offers a versatile toolkit for investigating a broad range of bio-molecular processes – not limited to liquid-liquid phase transition – and we anticipate their widespread application in future life-science research.
