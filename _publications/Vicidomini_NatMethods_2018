<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy provides subdiffraction resolution while preserving useful aspects of fluorescence microscopy, such as optical sectioning, and molecular specificity and sensitivity. However, sophisticated microscopy architectures and high illumination intensities have limited STED microscopy's widespread use in the past. Here we summarize the progress that is mitigating these problems and giving substantial momentum to STED microscopy applications. We discuss the future of this method in regard to spatiotemporal limits, live-cell imaging and combination with spectroscopy. Advances in these areas may elevate STED microscopy to a standard method for imaging in the life sciences.
