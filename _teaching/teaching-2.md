## Description
Image scanning microscopy (ISM) stands as the natural successor to confocal laser scanning microscopy, as it effectively addresses the trade-off between resolution and signal-to-noise ratio encountered in confocal microscopy. ISM replaces the pinhole and single-element detector with a fast detector array capable of registering an image for each position of the probed region, corresponding to every position of the focused laser beam across the sample. The resulting four-dimensional dataset is processed to generate a two-dimensional image of the sample with twice the resolution of diffraction-limited laser-scanning microscopy, without compromising the signal-to-noise ratio. 

## Content
The presentation is divided in the following parts:
- Part 1: The principle of confocal laser-scanning microscopy;
- Part 2: The resolution and signal-to-noise ratio tradeoff;
- Part 3: A brief history of image scanning microscopy (ISM);
- Part 4: The principle of ISM
- Part 5: The pixel-reassignment reconstruction method
